        <p>The Epson MX-80 is a printer released in 1980, originally under Shinshu Seiko Co., LTD. It is a dot-matrix impact printer. It connects to a computer using a parallel port.</p>
        <p>The Epson MX-80 was met with unprecedented consumer success, taking 60% of the Japanese market the first year after its release. This was partly due to its advanced printing features; it had a nine-pin printing head capable of bidirectional printing, meaning it could move left-to-right or right-to-left. It also had logic tracking.</p>
        <p>The Epson MX-80 was marketed as a robust printer for consumers. It was designed for use with IBM personal computers. The MX-80 is considered one of the most popular printers ever created.</p>
        <p>The MX-80 used 8.5 inch paper with tractor-feed perforations. A later version could use single-sheet paper as well. Epson still has drivers available for Windows 3.1, NT 3.x, 95, NT 4.x, and 98. There were reportedly drivers available for Windows 7 but none are  currently available for download.</p>

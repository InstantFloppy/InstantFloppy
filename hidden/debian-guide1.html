---TO YOUR NEW DEBIAN COMPUTER-----DEBIAN-GUIDE-1:-INSTALLATION<br />

	Or, should I say, good luck. Debian is quite a bit different<br />
to Windows! They use different command lines, different file-<br />
systems, different program types, different file types (ha!<br />
linux barely even uses extensions). Why?<br />
<br />
	FIRST, THERE WAS NOTHING<br />
<br />
	THEN, BELL LABORATORIES<br />
<br />
	Some rad punks at Bell (namely: Ken Thompson; Dennis<br />
Ritchie; Brian Kernighan; and other kickass engineers) were<br />
working on software at Bell for their Digital PDP-11, Multics<br />
(an operating system). Multics is still around, actually, for<br />
some reason. /They/ left the Multics project because it suuuuu-<br />
cked and then started a simpler OS project called Unix (because<br />
this was what people in the 60s thought was funny).<br />
	Unix is a big ol program that was like Windows back in the<br />
day, but better. Much better! It turned PDP-11s into wacked-out<br />
timesharing systems - multiple users could use the same<br />
computer, at the same time, in '69 or so. Crazy!<br />
	Unix grew quite a bit. QUITE a bit. And it was expensive.<br />
Like $500 for an installation medium, or like $1500 today.<br />
<br />
	I'm bored of talking about Unix. It was this rad program<br />
that could run other programs and multitask with them. It<br />
started out written in assembly (ones and zeroes 4eva!!!)<br />
and then the bros at Bell (no girls allowed!!!) re-wrote it in<br />
C ((a brand-new programming language))! Unix and C, they go<br />
together like cocaine and waffles. <br />
	Well, $500 is a sucky price when you can write your own OS<br />
for free. That's what the GNU project, started by like rms,<br />
was meant to do. A free replacement for Unix? What? GNU (stands<br />
for GNU is Not Unix) was this incredible OS that acted just<br />
like Unix, almost identically, but was totally free and open-<br />
source.<br />
	GNU didn't happen because they sucked at it. A kernel was<br />
made, called the HURD, and it /sort of/ works today. Don't use<br />
it. If Linux is a "hobby operating system", the HURD is a<br />
Java program written by Biron to beat AP CS or whatever. Even I<br />
don't use it.<br />
<br />
	THEN ANOTHER RAD PUNK APPEARED!<br />
<br />
	Linux Torvalds was working on his 386 machine out of boredom<br />
and somehow made the Linux kernal, then Linux itself. He was<br />
just, like, this dude, and he started working on Linux in '91<br />
or whenever. I bet GNU is probably still bitter.<br />
	Anyway, Linux is a (now) better version of Unix. Linux is a<br />
portmanteu of Linux and Unix, and it wasn't Linus's idea. There<br />
are also controversies about how Linux runs the Linux kernal<br />
code, and its Code of Conduct. Have fun Binging this stuff!<br />
<br />
	HOW DO I INSTALL THIS SHIT<br />
<br />
	First, format your hard disk as MBR. GPT doesn't work. I<br />
spent several days once trying to figure out why a drive<br />
wouldn't boot on GPT. It just doesn't. Bing it.<br />
	 _______________________________________________________<br />
	|			  |		|			<br />						    |		  |
	| a ton GB | 32GB	|			idk. whatever		    | 16GB |<br />
	|__________|______|______________________________|______|<br />
	 /home		  /												swap<br />
<br />
	This is how I have my drive formatted. Debian doesn't have<br />
a WYSIWYG partitioner (or maybe it does, I haven't used the<br />
graphical installer in years). If you want your user data<br />
(/home) on the same partition as your OS (/), you can just put<br />
/ as your everything and add a lil partition at the end for<br />
swap. Some people don't use a swap partition. I do. Most people<br />
would say the swap partition I use is absolutely absurd. Maybe.<br />
Bing it! Learn!<br />
	Most tutorials recommend beginners to put everything on /,<br />
no separate /home. Eh. Okay. If you reinstall your OS you'll<br />
lose all your data, and Debian hides everything in weird places<br />
so good luck backing that up quickly. The root only needs like<br />
32GB anyway, Debian itself takes up like 12GB or so and then<br />
native installed applications take up the rest of the space<br />
there.<br />
<br />
	WAIT, WHAT?! 20GB FOR NATIVE APPS?<br />
<br />
	Linux native apps use like 500K each. Kilobytes. Yes,<br />
really. Windows apps take up a fucking insane amount of space<br />
for some reason. I haven't come close to filling up my system<br />
partition and most of the apps I install are native.<br />
<br />
	NATIVE APPS?<br />
<br />
	Apps installed with the Debian and maybe some other package<br />
managers.<br />
<br />
	PACKAGE MANAGERS?<br />
<br />
	Apps that install other apps. There are a ton of these.<br />
You'll be using `apt` because you're not a hipster.<br />
<br />
	WHAT ABOUT GAMES?<br />
<br />
	Steam games install in your /home. So does Minecraft.<br />
<br />
	FILES?<br />
<br />
	All your media goes in /home. There is *NO REASON* to have a<br />
large root partition if your /home is in a separate partition.<br />
<br />
	OK.<br />
<br />
	Cool. Partitioning is the hardest part, the rest is cake.<br />
Except drivers. Drivers are weird. Just... talk to me. Ask me<br />
for help. Whatever you do, don't skip the "MISSING FIRMWARE<br />
FILE" error message or whatever, it'll be really weird.<br />
<br />
	DESKTOP SELECTION<br />
<br />
	- GNOME<br />
		This is the one Ubuntu uses. Megabloated. The traditional<br />
		"I'm using Linux and I'm better than you."<br />
	- XFCE<br />
		"I'm using Linux and my computer is trash, but I still<br />
		like things that look good and run well." I used this one<br />
		for a while, really liked it. Only reason I don't use it<br />
		still is because it doesn't fit my uses.<br />
	- Cinnamon<br />
		"I like Windows 7 but it actually looks good, and I don't<br />
		like things that look good." Decent, runs extremely well<br />
		and lightly, but looks really bad (in my experience). I<br />
		dunno, maybe you'll be able to get some mileage out of<br />
		it.<br />
	- KDE/Plasma<br />
		The one I use when I have to dip into the desktop. Looks<br />
		very nice, with very little effort, but it's a memory<br />
		sucker. Linux memory suckers use like 500MB idly, so<br />
		you won't even notice it, but don't run this on a<br />
		Raspberry Pi.<br />
	- OTHERS<br />
		Ok.<br />
	- NONE<br />
		Ha! Good luck. Linux terminal experience is REQUIRED for<br />
		this option, or the motivation to actually LEARN THINGS.<br />
<br />
	OTHERS<br />
	- '90s look<br />
		- I wanna look like Tim Berners-Lee in the 90s<br />
			Use WindowMaker. Talk to me.<br />
		- I wanna look like the Jurassic Park computers<br />
			Use MaXX. Talk to me. (The Jurassic Park computers<br />
			were real, and they ran Unix.)<br />
		- I wanna look like Windows 98 or 2000 or whatever<br />
			Excellent taste! Use XFCE and follow a tutorial to<br />
			install Chicago95 (Bing it).<br />
		- I wanna look like Windows XP<br />
			Me too.<br />
		- I wanna look like Windows Vista<br />
			Go fuck yourself, Ben.<br />
	- I wanna look like Windows 8/8.1/10<br />
		Why? Use something like the Zorin desktop environment.<br />
		Don't talk to me, I don't like you.<br />
	- I wanna look like MacOS<br />
		Use Plasma or the Elementary desktop.<br />
	- I wanna look like a hacker<br />
		Learn BASH. Use the shell.<br />
<br />
	ONE OF MY WEIRD PROPRIETARY PERIPHERALS ISN'T WORKING<br />
		Bing it.<br />
<br />
	MY GRAPHICS ARE GLITCHING OUT<br />
		Is it AMD?<br />
			YES.<br />
				You need to install the AMD drivers. Talk to me.<br />
		Is it NVidia?<br />
			YES.<br />
				Install the NVidia drivers.<br />
		Is it [something else]?<br />
			YES.<br />
				Bing it.<br />
<br />
	BUT I LIKE PEOPLE SPYING ON ME<br />
		Use:<br />
			Astra Linux (Debian + Russian code)<br />
			Ubuntu (has Canonical telemetry)<br />
			Red Hat (reportedly has IBM stuff on it)<br />
<br />
	BUT I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE SPYING ON ME<br />
		Use:<br />
			Trisquel<br />
			Tails<br />
<br />
	BUT I WANNA SPY ON PEOPLE<br />
		Use:<br />
			Kali<br />
<br />
	Have fun. If you bork your machine you can probably fix it.<br />
	I lost.<br />

			There used to be something here but it never quite achieved its goal.
			Instant Floppy is registered until 2025 and then will be retired.
			If you are one of the few with a mail@instantfloppy.net redirect, please contact me (I have already reached out) if you'd like to keep your e-mail.
			This site will continue to be accessible at the Internet Archive's WayBack Machine until the sands of time rust the machine's iron.
			At that point, it will be no more.

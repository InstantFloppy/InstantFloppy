# Instant Floppy
## Why is it called Instant Floppy?
A couple years ago I was working in an MS-DOS virtual machine and I was told by some program I needed to insert a blank floppy disk to put program files on it. I went to find a blank floppy IMG and couldn't find one. I could have run `DEL *.*` on a floppy in the virtual machine or used `dd` to make a blank image but I couldn't figure it out so I just suffered for a while. I decided then that I'd make a website with really obvious tech tutorials so people like me wouldn't have to suffer.

## Can't you just post somewhere else?
Yes, but since Github hosting is free I don't have to put ads on the site. Plus, it's much faster since I don't have to deal with all the needless `<div>`s WYSIWYG editors sprinkle into pages.

## Did it occur to you the name could be misinterpreted?
It did, but too late.

## Why is it ugly?
It looks good to me.

## How will you make money off of this?
Maybe someday I'll put ads on the page.

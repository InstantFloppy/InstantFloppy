# Instant Floppy

## Why is it called Instant Floppy?
A while ago I was working in an MS-DOS virtual machine and I was told by some program I needed to insert a blank floppy disk to put program files on it. It happened a while ago so the memory is a bit vague. I went to find a blank floppy IMG and couldn't find one - it should have been one of the simplest tasks I'd do that day but I couldn't find a single blank IMG. Later it dawned on me that I could have just run `DEL *.*` on a copy of some other IMG, but hindsight is 20/20. I decided then that I'd make a website with really obvious tech tutorials so people like me wouldn't have to suffer.

## Can't you just post somewhere else?
Yeah, but it's more fun this way. Since everything but the domain is free I don't have to put ads on my stuff and the website is pretty dang fast because of that.

## Did it occur to you the name could be misinterpreted?
Too late, unfortunately.

## Why are you doing this on GitHub?
I already had an account and other websites I've used just don't cut it. Raw, hand-coded HTML is the best HTML in my opinion.
